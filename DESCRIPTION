Description: Provides an R wrapper around the program 'spip'
    (<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2005.00884.x>), a C
    program for the simulation of pedigrees within age-structured populations
    with user-specified life histories.  Also includes a variety
    of functions to parse 'spip' output to compile information about
    related pairs amongst simulated, sampled individuals, to assess
    the feasibility and potential accuracy of close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR).
