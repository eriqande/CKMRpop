# Some things to do still!

This is, in reality, a longer list.  There are a lot of things that are unfinished,
but here are things that I don't want to forget to address at some point:

* Compile spip up for Linux.  This is essential for others that are 
not in a Mac lab to be able to us it (and for me to use it on the cluster).
* Really I should put all the spip code into the package and compile it up with
a few std vectors that get pushed_back onto for census, pedigree, and samples.
But, that would be a much longer term project!
